# Turn-based-game

A turn-based game GUI with different available characters, attack types, and attacks. The player chooses between the character types, namely: 
the swordsman, the mage, the palladin, the marksman, and the rogue, each with their own character stats with health and mana values differing per character 
type. The player then chooses either from different attack types under physical and magic attacks or to block, which reduces the amount of damage inflicted 
by the computer. The physical and magic attacks differ per character as well.

The code is written in C++ and uses the Visual Studio CLR (.NET Framework) template. The code includes the use of pointers, classes, file streaming, 
user-defined functions, arrays, control structures, templates, and input and output as well as the rand() function for the generation of the computer's 
attacks on the player. The game has two versions: one made as a project for my Object Oriented Programming subject and an improved version that I made in 
my spare time. The improved version includes: using a label to display all of the computer's attacks which were previously displayed in a message box, and 
a rand() function for the block button for the computer to either completely miss, or hit but with lesser damage.
